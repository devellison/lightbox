This is the firmware for an Adafruit RP2040 Feather.
Written for CircuitPython.

Right now, it provides a USB Serial interface with a set of commands
to set the lightbars to specific color combinations.  

Hardware documentation TBA, but basically right now it's a photography box with
a whole lot of RGBW/IR/UV LEDs, and a camera on top, all wired up to an
Adafruit Feather for control and a battery pack.
