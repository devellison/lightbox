# ZebralCam library

WORK IN PROGRESS
ZebralCam is not ready to be integrated into applications yet.

Provides crossplatform cameras with control options and hardware identification.

ZebralCam is being written as a part of the Lightbox project, but it's intended to stand
alone as well once it's done.

So far, Windows is working with C++/WinRT. Linux currently is using V4L2. 
Advanced controls (exposure/focus) aren't yet provided, but you can capture frames.
