# Zebral library

WORK IN PROGRESS
The Zebral Library is currently under active development.

The initial focus is ZebralCam, to provide crossplatform access to web cameras with easy access to controls and hardware identification.  It works now (Windows/Ubuntu), but is still under active development.

So far, there are 3 libraries:
  zebralcommon: Base errors, logging, etc. used in Zebral libraries
  zebralcam: Provides crossplatform cameras with control options and hardware identification.
  zebralserial: Will provide some basic serial communications classes

Zebral is being written as a part of the Lightbox project, but it's intended to stand
alone as well once it's done.

You should be able to build this directory solo, or integrate it easily with other projects.
