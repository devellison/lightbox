# ZebralCam library

WORK IN PROGRESS
ZebralCam is not ready to be integrated into applications yet.

Provides crossplatform cameras with control options and hardware identification.

ZebralCam is being written as a part of the Lightbox project, but it's intended to stand
alone as well once it's done and will likely get its own repository at that point.

You should be able to build this directory solo, or integrate it easily with other projects.

So far, Windows is working with C++/WinRT.  Advanced controls (exposure/focus) aren't yet provided.
Linux currently is using OpenCV for testing, but planning to target V4L2 directly soon.
